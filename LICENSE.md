What? You thought you were going to see painful legal info? For this puny thing?!

These details have been paraphrased by the game's "About" section in the exe.

The code is public domain and can be used absolutely freely.

For my art assets (especially characters), use common sense when it comes to use of someone else's characters
and all. For now, think of it like Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial Sharealike, but without that
legal stuff shoved down your throat.

The music used is Watered Down Hell by FLiNX. You can download it directly by going to
http://ftp.t-pas.net/downmod.php?index=26505. Be respectful of the creator here, too, even though it's very obscure
like many tracker modules.
