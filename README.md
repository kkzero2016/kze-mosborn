# Koonhai Zero Expeditions: Mosborn Cave
This is a small VB6 game I made for my final projeect in school Computer Science I (yes, they were STILL using VB6 this year!)
It's a small RPG demo where all you do is walk around and fight every enemy you encounter until you die. I would've
fleshed it out more, but time was the issue here.

May as well put this thing up on this wonderful service so we can all stare at my mid-late-2010s coding in a late-1990s
programming language. Not that it has a use, but it's here. 

For more information on Koonhai Zero, refer to http://creo.wikia.com/wiki/Koonhai_Zero.

Someday, I'll expand on this small concept using a modern programming language and tools. I am loyal to the
expansion of my coding skills and characters.
